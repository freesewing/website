Freesewing is proudly multilingual, and for this we depend on you to help us.
Anytime you see something that's poorly translated, you can jump right in and fix it.

That page tells you everything you need to know to do that.

## Languages

English is our origin language. Which means that everything is written in English
and then translated from English into other languages.

We currently support the following five languages:

  - **en** : English (our origin language)
  - **de** : German
  - **es** : Spanish
  - **fr** : French
  - **nl** : Dutch

If you'd like to start working on a new language, that's great, but a bit
beyond the scope of this documentation. So in that case, 
please [come and talk to us on Gitter](https://gitter.im/freesewing/freesewing).


## Types of translation work

There are two types of translation:

### Strings

Strings means all of the words and sentences that are used in our code. 
Strings are always stored in YAML files, which have the `.yaml` extension.

For details about the specifics, 
see [the documentation on translating strings](/en/docs/translator/strings).

### Content

Content are things like documentation, blog posts, and so on. 
Content is always stored in MarkDown files, which have the `.md` entension.

For details about the specifics, 
see the [documentation on translating content](/en/docs/translator/content).
