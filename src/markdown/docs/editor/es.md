title: Documentation for editors
path: /en/docs/editor
---

Anybody with an account on freesewing.org can make changes to our website. Whether it's a documentation page (like this one), a blog post, or showcase, if you see something that can be improved, go ahead and change it.

Behind the title of all of these pages, you will find two icons you can click:

- A small pencil icon to edit the page
- A small GitHub logo that links to this file on GitHub

Both icons serve the same purpose: Allowing anyone to suggest changes to our content. But they do it in a slightly different way.

## Making changes online

The pencil icon will open an editor that will let you make your changes right here on the freesewing.org website. When you save them, they will be submitted for review.

All our content is written in MarkDown. If you're new to MarkDown, [read our MarkDown help page](/en/docs/markdown/) and you'll see it's really easy.

## Making changes via GitHub

Those of you who are familiar with git and GitHub can fork [our website repository](https://github.com/freesewing/website), make all the changes you want, and then submit a pull request.

It's essentially the same thing as the online editor does behind the scenes. But this allows you to work on it off-line and use the MarkDown editor of your choice.

Speaking of which, all our content is written in MarkDown and stored in the [`src/markdown`](https://github.com/freesewing/website/tree/develop/src/markdown) folder of [our website repository](https://github.com/freesewing/website). There are three sub-folders because we have three types of content:

- [`docs`](https://github.com/freesewing/website/tree/develop/src/markdown/docs) : Holds our documentation
- [`blog`](https://github.com/freesewing/website/tree/develop/src/markdown/blog) : Holds our blog posts
- [`showcase`](https://github.com/freesewing/website/tree/develop/src/markdown/showcase) : Holds our showcase posts

The only difference is that they have different *frontmatter*, which is a metadata that is included at the start of the file. Documentation has a title, but a blog post has a title and and image, and so on. This information is stored in the frontmatter at the start of the file.

Each documentation page, blog post or showcase sits in its own directory, with one MarkDown file for each language.
