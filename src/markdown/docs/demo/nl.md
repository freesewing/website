Welcome to our demo, where you can try out freesewing without the need for an account.

Choose a pattern to get started. Once you do, a preview will appear here, along with all the patterns configuration options for you to play with.

> ##### The real thing is even better
> 
> While this playground gives you a good idea of what to expect, there are some limitations:
> 
> - You cannot save or download your pattern
> - We use a default set of measurements, so you can't draft a pattern to your own size

A freesewing account is free of charge, and allows you to do this and more. If you'd like, you can [sign up here](/en/signup).

If you have questions, our [frequently asked questions](/en/docs/faq) is a good place to start.
