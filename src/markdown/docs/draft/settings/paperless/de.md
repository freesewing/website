Paperless patterns have extra markings to use them without a printer

The idea is that with the help of the grid and the extra dimensions, you don't need to print the pattern. Instead, you can transfer it directly on to fabric, or onto a intermediate medium such as drafting paper.

## History

When I started writing freesewing, one of the things I wanted to achieve was to make it more inclusive (in comparison to makemypattern.com).

For that, I had earmarked two features:

- Support for multiple languages
- Find a way for people who don't have access to a printer to still use the patterns

The first one is supported, with translation ongoing. The second is a trickier problem.

Computer and internet access are much more prevalent than access to a printer and a paper. To reach as many people as possible, I wanted a way get rid of the requirement of a printer.

After giving it some thought, I decided to try and make patterns that one can transfer directly on to fabric, or onto an intermediate medium such as pattern paper.
